C - Variables, if, else, while

0. [Positive anything is better than negative nothing](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) - Creating a program that will assign a random number to the variable 'n' each time is execute and then print whether the number stored is positive or negative.

1. [The last digit](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) - Creating a program that will assign a random number to a variable; print the last digit of that variable and determine whether that digit is greater than 5, less than 6 and not 0 or is 0.

2. [I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) - Creating a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.

3. [alphABET](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) - Creating a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase.

4. [When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) - Creating a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for q and e.

5. [Numbers](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c) - Creating a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

6. [Numberz](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c) - Creating a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, but as characters.

7. [Smile in the mirror](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) - Creating a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.

8. [Hexadecimal](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c) - Creating a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

9. [Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c) - Creating a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, where the numbers must be separated by a comma followed by a space.
