This is my introduction into low-level programming. The first language I am discovering and learning is C.

0. [C - Hello World](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/hello_world)

1. [C - Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/variables_if_else_while)

2. [C - Functions, nested loops](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/functions_nested_loops)

3. [C - Makefiles](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/makefiles)

4. [C - More function, more nested loops](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/more_functions_nested_loops)

5. [C - Pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/hewsontrinh526/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/pointers_arrays_strings)
